# GameLens

GameLens is a small Ionic + Angular + Capacitor app that lets you **scan a QR code** containing a RAWG game ID and display details about that game.

This project was built as a first contact / exercise with Ionic and Capacitor.

   export RAWG_TOKEN=your_rawg_api_key_here
   bash scripts/generate-env.sh
   ```

   On Windows (PowerShell):

   $env:RAWG_TOKEN="your_rawg_api_key_here"
   .\scripts\generate-env.ps1
   ```

4. **Run in the browser**

   ```bash
   ionic serve
   ```

5. **Build for native platforms**

   ```bash
   npx cap sync
   npx cap open android   # for Android
   npx cap open ios       # for iOS
   ```


## Possible Improvements

* Better UI and error handling
* Caching and offline mode
* Support for more RAWG endpoints (trailers, screenshots, etc.)
